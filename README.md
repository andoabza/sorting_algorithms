    O(1)
    O(n)
    O(n!)
    n square -> O(n^2)
    log(n) -> O(log(n))
    n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
    n + k -> O(n+k)
    …

Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.
